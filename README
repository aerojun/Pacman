This is the README file for the proyect: "Pacman in C".

Greetings stranger!,

Basically the title says it all, but here is the uncut version.

This game was the final proyect for our data-structure class. It is really basic, and has a simple logic.
The proyect was developed using Visual Studio 2008 and Visual C++ Express 2010 on Windows XP and Windows 7.
I don't know if it is going to work in your machine. (So start testing).

I'll be trying to push a version for C++0x.
The problem is that i don't know how to remplace the headers "Windows.h" and "Conio.h".
So i've to read to fix that.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We created this games based on the idea we found on a web forum.
You can create a better version of this one. I'll be glad if you do.

Stay Golden!.
